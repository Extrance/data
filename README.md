Hey, this repo is meant to store json files for another project of mine.
This project can be found by typing on your browser extrance.github.io :)

I am experimenting with GH pages and wanted to store in an easy way data for this project, separating data from logic.

Even if you're not interested in this web-app, in this repo you can find json file containing details of my LEGO collection.
I plan also on providing files for the individual LEGO sets, providing a general overview for each, plus my personal take on each set.
